								<p>Any digital identity (e-identity) service is built on relationships between the identity provider, those whose digital identity it manages (individuals), and the service providers (government departments, private sector entities, etc). For such a service to be successful – that is, it is of value to the citizens and relying parties, and is sustainable over the long term – it is essential that all parties trust the service operator: citizens trust it to handle their private data securely and to manage their digital identity, and service providers trust it to ensure that the asserted identities are reliable.</p>

							<h2>The Appropriate Use of Digital Identity</h2>
							<p id="blurb">Read and comment: <a href="evaluation-framework-01.html">Draft framework</a> by CIS</p>

							<p>As governments across the globe implement new, foundational, digital identification systems (“Digital ID”), or modernize existing ID programs, there is dire need for greater research and discussion about appropriate uses of Digital ID systems. This significant momentum for creating Digital ID in several parts of the world has been accompanied with concerns about the privacy and exclusion harms of a state issued
Digital ID system, resulting in campaigns and litigations in countries such as UK, India, Kenya, and Jamaica. Given the very large range of
considerations required to evaluate Digital ID projects, it is necessary to think of evaluation frameworks that can be used for this purpose.</p>
							<p>At RightsCon 2019 in Tunis, we are presenting <a href="" target="_blank">working drafts</a> on appropriate use of Digital ID by the partner organisations of this <a href="https://www.omidyar.com/blog/appropriate-use-digital-identity-why-we-invested-three-region-research%C2%A0alliance" target="_blank">three-region research alliance</a> - ITS from Brazil, CIPIT from Kenya, and CIS from India.</p>
							<p>In the <a href="evaluation-framework-01.html" target="_blank">draft by CIS</a>, we propose a set of principles against which Digital ID may be evaluated. We hope that these draft principles can evolve into a set of best practices that can be used by policymakers when they create and implement Digital ID systems, provide guidance to civil society examinations of Digital ID and highlight questions for further research on the subject. We have drawn from approaches used
in documents such as the necessary and proportionate principles, the OECD privacy guidelines and scholarship on harms based approaches.</p>

							<h2>Systems Thinking in Design</h2>
							<p id="blurb">We invited <a href="https://in.linkedin.com/in/dineshkorjan" target="_blank">Dinesh Korjan</a> to our Delhi office on May 27-28 to conduct a workshop about using systems thinking in design. The workshop was a step towards devising a rigourous and multidisciplinary methodology to study digital identity ecosystems globally. 
							<p id="blurb">Dinesh is a proponent of the strategic use of design for the larger good, a mentor at the <a href="http://nif.org.in/" target="_blank">National Innovation Foundation</a> and he heads Korjan 2.0.</p>

							<h2>The Appropriate Use of Digital Identity: Why We Invested in a Three-Region Research Alliance</h2>

							<p>We are happy to announce a new research grant on Digital Identities at the Centre for Internet and Society (CIS). This grant is supported by <a href="https://www.omidyarnetwork.in/" target="_blank">Omidyar Network India</a>, as part of a three region alliance to be co-led by the <a href="https://itsrio.org/en/en-home/" target="_blank">Institute for Technology & Society (ITS), Brazil</a>, the <a href="https://www.cipit.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Intellectual Property and Information Technology Law (CIPIT)</a>, Kenya, and the CIS, India — on the Appropriate Use of Digital Identity. As part of this Alliance, we at the CIS will look at the policy objectives of digital identity projects, how technological policy choices can be thought through to meet the objectives, and how legitimate uses of a digital identity framework may be evaluated.</p>
							<p>There is significant momentum on creation of digital identity projects especially after the adoption of <a href="https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg16" target="_blank">UN Sustainable Development Goal 16.9</a>, which calls for legal identity for all by 2030. Given the importance of this subject, its implications for both the development agenda as well its impact on civil, social and economic rights, there is a need for more focused research that can enable policymakers to take better decisions, guide civil society in different jurisdictions to comment on and raise questions about digital identity schemes, and provide actionable material to the industry to create identity solutions that are privacy enhancing and inclusive. We look forward to producing research that can contribute to the above.</p>
