							<h2><em>Rule of Law</em></h2>
						</header>
						<div class="content">
							<p>The rise of digial ID systems and the opportunities it presents both for public and private actors have often resulted in hasteful implementations and adoptions. This does not allow for sufficient deliberation to lead to governance mechanisms.</p>
							<p>Below we attempt to develop a set of draft principles against which the uses of ID must be evaluated. These are the most basic tests to ensure that a rule of law framework exists to govern the use of ID.</p>

							<h5>Legislative Mandate</h5>
							<h3>Is the project backed by a validly enacted law?</h3>
							<p id="desc">Digital ID systems, by their nature, will entail greater collection of personally identifiable information and privacy risks. Any such limitation must be prescribed by law in the form of a publicly available legislative act. Other forms of the law such as executive ordinance only meet this requirement in a limited ways.</p>

							<h5>Defining Actors and Purposes</h5>
							<h3>Does the law clearly specify the actor and the purposes?</h3>
							<p id="desc">The law must clearly specify the actors, or a category of actors, who may use the ID. The actors include entities who may use the ID as well as agencies and databases to whom the ID may be connected in any way. Similarly, the purposes for which the ID is used must also be clearly backed by law.<br /><br /></p>
